/**
 * The capture business logic, separated from the AJAX handler so it can be
 * unit-tested without `wp_send_json_*` exits.
 *
 * Contract:
 *
 *  1. Look up payments for the order (via `Payments::get_by_rrn` against
 *     the order's RRN).
 *  2. Pick the first `AUTHORIZED` payment that also has `canCapture: true`
 *     (Maya marks an authorization non-capturable once it expires or the
 *     remaining balance hits zero).
 *  3. Validate `$amount` is positive and ≤ remaining (authorized − already-captured).
 *  4. POST the capture to Maya with `requestReferenceNumber` set to the order id.
 *  5. Return the updated balance trio so the UI can re-render without re-fetching.
 *
 * The processor never mutates the order itself — the merchant sees the
 * capture happen, but the order's WC status flip waits for the
 * `PAYMENT_SUCCESS` webhook the capture triggers. Keeps the source of truth
 * single (the webhook) and avoids races between the API response and the
 * webhook arriving.
